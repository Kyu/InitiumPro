### Auto-flee

### Auto-swing
***
* After you start your attack, you will keep attacking with the same weapon until you win the fight, or hit another weapon shortcut key. This is off by default, and can be turned on in the settings by changing AUTO_SWING to true. Inspired by how CircleMUD battles work :)

### Automatically confirm popups

* **C** - Create new campsite
* **H** - Show hidden paths

***
* You automatically rest when you enter a rest area with any damage
* Option to automatically "Leave and forget" a battle site after winning (set AUTO_LEAVE_FORGET to true in the options)

* Navigation buttons are now compact
* Type of area you are in is now visible in the top-left
